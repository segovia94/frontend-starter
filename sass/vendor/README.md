# Vendor CSS

This directory can contain any 3rd party vendor libraries that can't be installed with NPM.

Don't add any Sass in this folder.

Ideally nothing needs to be in this folder. It is preferable to use NPM to add dependencies.

CSS in this directory will be compiled with NPM components into a **/dist/vendor.css** file.
