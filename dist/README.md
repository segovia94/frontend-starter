This directory will be auto-generated. Do not directly edit anything in this 
folder or it will be overwritten the next time Sass and Js are compiled.

# CSS

Each file in the **/sass** directory will be processed with LibSass and added to
this directory.

The main file generated in this directory will be **/dist/style.css**


# Javascript

Each file in the **/js** directory will be concatenated into a single
**/dist/scripts.js** file.
