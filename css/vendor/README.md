# Vendor CSS

This directory can contain any 3rd party vendor libraries that can't be installed with Bower.

Don't add and Sass in this folder. All sass belongs in **/sass**.

Ideally nothing needs to be in this folder. It is preferable to use Bower to add dependencies.

CSS in this directory will be compiled with bower components into a **/css/vendor.css** file.
